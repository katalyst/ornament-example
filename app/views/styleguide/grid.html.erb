  <h2 class="heading-four">Grid classes</h2>

  <p>A grid is made of an outer-wrapper class, <code>grid</code>, and inner column classes, <code>grid-x</code>.</p>

  <p>To create two columns, one 4/12, the other 8/12, can be done using <code>grid-4</code>Â and <code>grid-8</code>.</p>

  <div>
    <div class="grid">

      <div class="grid-4">
        <div class="panel__default">
          This column has a class of grid-4
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-8">
        <div class="panel__default">
          This column has a class of grid-8
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These are percentage-based grids, so they will respond down as you scale your browser.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-four">Mobile grids</h2>

  <p>If you want to alter the grids on mobile, you can pass in <code>grid-x-small</code> classes as well:</p>

  <div>
    <div class="grid">

      <div class="grid-4 grid-12-small">
        <div class="panel__default">
          This column has a class of grid-4 and grid-12-small
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-8 grid-12-small">
        <div class="panel__default">
          This column has a class of grid-8 and grid-12-small
        </div>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h2 class="heading-four">Equal grids</h2>

  <p>To create equal grids, you can swap your wrapper class for <code>grid__x</code>, where x represents the word for a number. Each of the grid columns will then use the class <code>column</code>, rather than a <code>grid-x</code> class.</p>

  <p>To create a four column grid, you would use <code>grid__four</code>.</p>

  <div>
    <div class="grid__four">

      <%- (1..4).each do |i| -%>
        <div class="column">
          <div class="panel__default">
            This column only has a class of column
          </div>
        </div>
      <%- end -%>

    </div>
  </div>  

  <p>These pre-made grid layouts have pre-defined breakpoints. As you scale the browser you can see the four column grid break to three, then two, then one.</p>
