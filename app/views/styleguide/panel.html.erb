  <h2 class="heading-two">Panels and colour variants</h2>

  <p>To create a panel, all you need is a <code>panel</code> class:</p>

  <div class="panel">
    This is a panel
  </div>

  <p>To create a blue panel, you can use the <code>panel__blue</code> class instead:</p>

  <div class="panel__blue">
    Blue panel
  </div>

  <p>You can create custom panel classes by adding colour variations to the <code>panel.css.scss</code> file.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-two">Panel padding</h2>

  <p>There are a few options you have when applying padding to a panel. You can use <code>panel--padding__large</code>, which has large padding:</p>

  <div class="panel panel--padding__large">
    Panel with large, responsive padding
  </div>

  <p>You can use <code>panel--padding</code>, which has regular padding:</p>

  <div class="panel panel--padding">
    Panel with responsive padding
  </div>

  <p>Or you can use the <code>panel--padding__tight</code> class, which has small padding:</p>

  <div class="panel panel--padding__tight">
    Panel with tight padding
  </div>

  <p>The large and regular padding variants use reponsive padding, which means as the screen size shrinks, so does the padding.</p>

  <p>The large becomes regular, then tight. The regular becomes tight. The tight padding variant is already at the smallest padding size, so that one is not responsive. </p>

  <h2 class="heading-two">Stacking panels</h2>

  <p>You can stack panels by adding in the <code>panel__no-bottom-radius</code> and <code>panel__no-top-radius</code> classes:</p>

  <div class="panel panel__blue panel--padding panel__no-bottom-radius">
    Blue panel with no bottom radius
  </div>

  <div class="panel panel--padding panel__no-top-radius">
    Panel with no top radius
  </div>

  <p>This is the reason why panels don't have padding by default, so that panels can stack and have independant padding.</p>

</div>
